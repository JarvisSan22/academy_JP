### Working together to tackle the plastic waste problem
The plastic problem can only be tackled by a strong, united movement of people and projects collaborating together.

Precious Plastic can do a lot to help Precious Plastic Spaces around the world. Likewise, Precious Plastic Spaces around the world can do a lot to help grow Precious Plastic. The stronger Precious Plastic (the movement), the stronger Precious Plastic Spaces, the greater the impact on plastic pollution.
