# Community Program

### Working together to tackle the plastic waste problem
The plastic problem is big. At Precious Plastic we believe that it can only be tackled by a strong, united movement of people and projects collaborating together.

Precious Plastic can do a lot to help Precious Plastic Spaces around the world. Likewise, Precious Plastic Spaces around the world can do a lot to help grow the Precious Plastic movement. The stronger Precious Plastic (the movement), the stronger Precious Plastic Spaces, the greater the impact on plastic pollution.

ü§ú <b>The more you help Precious Plastic the more Precious Plastic will help you!</b> ü§õ


###  What Precious Plastic can do for Spaces
Precious Plastic already provides all the tools and platforms for free for the world to use. On top of that Precious Plastic can help Spaces around the world by featuring them in its communication channels (100K+ combined), feature them in sales channels (IG store, Bazar and more), and finally opening up partnership opportunities.


###  What Spaces can do for Precious Plastic
Precious Plastic Spaces can greatly help Precious Plastic by crediting and mentioning they‚Äôre part of Precious Plastic on their websites, social media and communication. This way more people can come across Precious Plastic and grow the movement. Sharing back your knowledge is also much appreciated and helpful.
