### Open Source rating

Rating is introduced to make sure we can see at which stage drawings are. To make sure the once that have been running for a while withstand time score a high rating and new drawings need to go to a verification process.

| Rating |  Description           |
|---------|------------|
| <img src="../assets/guides/opensource_01.png" width="50px"/> |   **Not Open Source** <br> The drawings of this machine are not shared Open Source.          |
| <img src="../assets/guides/opensource_02.png" width="50px"/> |  **Open Source** <br>  The drawings are uploaded according to our guidelines (below)          |
| <img src="../assets/guides/opensource_03.png" width="50px"/> |  **Reviewed** <br>  Same as above + the drawings are also positivly reviewed by us        |
| <img src="../assets/guides/opensource_04.png" width="50px"/> |  **Tested** <br> Same as above + we tested tested the machine in real life and it works good.    |
| <img src="../assets/guides/opensource_05.png" width="50px"/> |  **Quality** <br>  + we and other community members used the machines for a long period of time and it works well    |



### Difficulty level
Difficulty levels is to indicate how complex the tooling is needed to make the machines. This will give a better understanding upfront of the complexity you are going into. They are divided into 5 different levels.

| Difficulty level |        Description     |
|---------|------------|
| <img src="../assets/guides/level_1.png" width="50px"/> | **Level 1** <br>  Only grinder / drill / welding
| <img src="../assets/guides/level_2.png" width="50px"/> | **Level 2** <br> Same as above + lasercut / heating element cabling
| <img src="../assets/guides/level_3.png" width="50px"/> | **Level 3** <br> Same as above + lathe work / motor cabling
| <img src="../assets/guides/level_4.png" width="50px"/> | **Level 4** <br> Same as above + milling / multiple axis lathe work / VFD
| <img src="../assets/guides/level_5.png" width="50px"/> | **Level 5** <br> Same as above + steel milling / pneumatic system or hydraulic system and some other complex stuff. Get yourself ready.
