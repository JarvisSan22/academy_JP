# Get featured on the Bazar 

Every month, the Precious Plastic Bazar promotes a selection of listings on the Homepage.

**Here we'll explain our framework to make the selection, so you can get an idea how to make your listings easy to feature :)** 

## Goals

By selecting items to be shown on the Homepage, the Bazar team aims to:

1. **Showcase great listings** in order to show users the diversity and quality of items available on the Bazar.

2. **Give visibility to great sellers** who respect the selection criterias (see below) as well as help increase their engagement on the Bazar.

3. **Increase sales** for the sellers that offer a great quality and service

## Frequency

- The selection will be done on a monthly basis.
- The new selection will be uploaded the first of the month.
- Sellers with selected products will be informed via email a few days before.


## Selection criteria üßê

**Only listings that match the following criterias will have the chance to be promoted on the homepage.**

Criteria | Explanation | Priority level <span style="color:white"> </span>
--- | --- | ---
**Profile quality** | We would like to promote listings of sellers who put effort and care into their profiles and follow the **[Guidelines to set up a Seller Account](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/business/Account_Setup)** | Essential
**Listing quality** | A listing will be selected if it was set up well and meets the **[Listing Guidelines](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/business/Image_Size_Guidelines)**. | Essential
Rank in the **top 25** of relevant KPI | The listing must be in the top 25 of the relevant analysis. *For example, for the most sold items, we will base our selection on the sales of the previous period.* | Essential
**Not previously featured** | A listing that was already on the homepage in the past two months will not be selected. | Nice to have
**Listing diversity** | Different types of listings will be selected within a section. *For example: We won‚Äôt select 2 moulds of the same shape.* | Nice to have
**Seller diversity** | We aim to showcase listings from various sellers, to equally promote different projects in different countries. | If possible
